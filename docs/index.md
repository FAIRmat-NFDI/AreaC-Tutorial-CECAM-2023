# Introduction

This page contains the documents following the [FAIRmat tutorial 10](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/events/fairmat-tutorial-10/tutorial-10-home), presented on 14.06.2023 by Luca M. Ghiringhelli, Nathan Daelman, and Jos√© M. Pizarro. It is divided in five main parts:

1. [Part I: How to explore the NOMAD Archive and Repository.](part1.md)
2. [Part II: How to make an upload and query NOMAD.](part2.md)
4. [Part III: Numerical precision in _ab initio_ calculations.](part3.md)
5. [Part IV: Workflows and how to link DFT and beyond-DFT calculations.](part4.md)
3. [Part V: Knowledge-based XC functional exploration.](part5.md)


New organization

- I think I will ask them to get an account before the tutorial starts

1. [Part I: How to explore the NOMAD Archive and Repository.](part1.md)
    - this section is still probably relevant, but maybe present it as more of an overview of the features...should also mention the AI toolkit
    - let's also add some specific things about MD - how to currently search for MD by code or by method.
    - should also mention the big MD dataset
2. [Part II: How to make an upload and query NOMAD.](part2.md)
    - leave the upload part, I think remove the querying for now
    - maybe combine some of the new general docs with my tutorial walk through for water
4. [Part III: Numerical precision in _ab initio_ calculations.](part3.md)
    - This section is probably not relevant, plan to remove
5. [Part IV: Workflows and how to link DFT and beyond-DFT calculations.](part4.md)
    - Take some aspects of this and combine it with my tutorial # 2
3. [Part V: Knowledge-based XC functional exploration.](part5.md)
    - remove
6. Then here we need to add part 3 of the tutorial I think, but maybe this time we can actually
