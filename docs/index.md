# Introduction

This tutorial provides an overview of using the NOMAD software, with a focus on support for classical molecular simulations.
NOMAD is a free open-source data management platform for Materials Science which follows the F.A.I.R. (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles [@Wilkinson2016;@goFairWeb], and is developed primarily by the [FAIRmat consortium](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat).

**TODO add some short description of the scope and other areas**
