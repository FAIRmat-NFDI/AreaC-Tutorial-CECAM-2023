# Introduction

This tutorial provides an overview of using the NOMAD software, with a focus on support for classical molecular simulations.
NOMAD is a free open-source data management platform for Materials Science which follows the F.A.I.R. (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles [@Wilkinson2016;@goFairWeb], and is developed primarily by the [FAIRmat consortium](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat).

**TODO add some short description of the scope and other areas**

**@ndaelman-hu I am actually not sure if I want to add much else here. I don't think we really want to complicate the message with a bunch of information about FAIRmat organization and such. We could mention that NOMAD has not only computational data, but I think this is something that you mention along the way in the tutorial anyway. Given the limited amount of time, I am thinking we leave this VERY short introduction and just get them going on exploring NOMAD. What do you think?**
