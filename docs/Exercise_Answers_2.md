1. This is an NVT annealing simulation to cool the system from ~1000 k to ~300 k. As the temperature cools, the molecules aggregate, as indicated by the growing peaks in the rdfs. However, the pressure remains low due to the (fixed) large box size.

2. This is an NPT simulation, performed at ~300 k. Mid-way through the simulation there is a clear transition in the potential energy and an increase in the pressure, indicating that the box is contracting and the system is entering a proper liquid phase. This is validated through the rdfs, which become properly normalized to 1 at large distances later in the trajectory.

3. This is a fully equilibrated NPT simulation.
