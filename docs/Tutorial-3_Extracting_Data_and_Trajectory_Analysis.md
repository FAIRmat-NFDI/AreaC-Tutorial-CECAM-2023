## <center> **Tutorial 3: Extracting data and trajectory analysis** </center>

TODO - this part is not so much about NOMAD, and doesn't even do a query. The problem with a query is this example data is not published.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to work with MD data stored on the archive. The tutorial is split into two sections (with corresponding sub-directories): 1. `Protein-Water_Structure/` and 2. `Polymer_Glass_Transition/`.  Within each directory, you will find an ipython notebook that contains the relevant information and walk-through.


OTHER IDEAS:

- do we want to show something about H5MD? I guess we are not quite ready yet.

- I am actually thinking that we should change the last part of the tutorial, it's not so much about NOMAD. Instead we could query the same entry and then do some featurization, or visualization in the notebook as before?
